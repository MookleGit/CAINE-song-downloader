This song downloader script was written to make my life easier.
CAINE, my anime club, does an activity called song trivia, and so we don't have to wait for the internet/youtube to load, it's faster if we download the songs.

Since we compile the songs between officers on Google Sheets, I made this script to download all the songs in one go.

I might make some additional changes later on, but at the moment it's mostly functional.

By default, it trims all mp3s to 30 seconds long, or until end of mp3 if it's too short.
The full mp3 will be in the "songs" folder, and the trimmed versions will be in the "trims" folder.
Because the original purpose was for trivia, the mp3s are numerically named as to not give away answers.

I may add some options later to rename them, as well as to rename/specify different folders.

YOU WILL NEED FFMPEG.EXE AND FFPROBE.EXE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE .PY OR .EXE FOR IT TO WORK.
I HAVE SUPPLIED BOTH WITHIN THE .RAR FILE
